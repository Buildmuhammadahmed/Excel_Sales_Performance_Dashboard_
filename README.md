## Project Overview

This dashboard gives a clear picture of sales performance between 2015–2018. It helps answer key business questions: Are sales growing over time? Which regions and products are performing best? Who are the main customer segments? The value it delivers is faster reporting, easier identification of top-performing areas, and better support for sales planning and decision-making.

**Objectives:**
- Track total sales and sales trends by quarter and year.
- Identify high-performing regions and product categories.
- Surface customer segmentation insights (corporate, home office, consumer).
- Provide an interactive view for quick decision-making using slicers and filter controls.
